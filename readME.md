# Things I would like to change / add #

More filler content.

Login to a unique myspace page that allows the reader to add, edit their blogs to make it look how they want!

Work with CSS a bit more to add in the flex box, to have things flow more smoothly.

I also wouldnt mind changing the theme of the website to something like yahoo or AOL to make it more time appropriate-ish?
